# DeGov DAO's contracts

Not all the teams behind the DAOs that have the capability to code their own governance contracts.
Sometimes they need help from the DeGov team to deploy their contracts. This repository contains the contracts that are used by the DAOs that are part of the DeGov ecosystem, all the parameters and deployments are transparent and can be verified on the specific networks.
